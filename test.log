[18:48:32] <Botten_Lao> LaoD: I am a bot!
[18:48:38] <Lucas_F98> Sugarloaf0: and it has a case LD
[18:48:44] <Lucas_F98> * :D
[18:48:46] <LaoD> :D
[18:48:54] <LaoD> it's working now...
[18:48:57] <LaoD> ok
[18:48:59] <LaoD> tpg
[18:49:04] <LaoD> :D :D :D
[18:50:04] <Sugarloaf0> tpg
[18:50:32] <Sugarloaf0> TPG
[18:50:57] <spake> i thought it was supposed to be if someone logged in with tpg?
[18:51:07] <LaoD> working on that
[18:51:12] <Sugarloaf0> spake: I think that's the intention.
[18:51:33] <spake> LaoD: what are you using to run the bot?
[18:51:55] <LaoD> spake: python, twisted lib
[18:52:07] <spake> LaoD: ah, okay
[18:52:10] <ryannathans> tpg is really good aye
[18:52:23] <LaoD> apparently not xD
[18:52:34] <Sugarloaf0> tpg tpg tpg
[18:52:34] <Lucas_F98> Sugarloaf0: http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/dso-nano-v2-p-681.html?cPath=174 seems cool... little pricy but only 200kHz sampling
[18:52:38] <NCSSBot> Title: DSO Nano v2  [TOL131B2P] - $89.00 : Seeed Studio Bazaar, Boost ideas, extend the reach
[18:52:41] <LaoD> nope
[18:53:15] <Sugarloaf0> Lucas_F98: The hardware fails anywhere beyond that anyway. I think they've limited it for a good reason.
[18:54:17] <Lucas_F98> yeah...  probs gonna get this... 1mHz  >>  http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/ARM-Dso201-Portable-Pocket-sized-Mini-Nano-Handheld-Digital-Storage-Oscilloscope-/120846229843?pt=AU_B_I_Electrical_Test_Equipment&hash=item1c22ff2153

[18:55:55] <Sugarloaf0> Lucas_F98: Neat.
[18:58:40] <Sugarloaf0> Lucas_F98: I'm surprised there aren't more of these things around.
[18:59:12] <Lucas_F98> as in people having them... or as in different models?
[18:59:30] <Sugarloaf0> As in cheap DSOs.
[19:02:06] <Lucas_F98> yeah there only seems to be about 4 models

[19:02:33] <Sugarloaf0> Lucas_F98: The CPU for the ~$200 costs <$10. Trying to find a price for the FPGA.
[19:02:56] <Lucas_F98> yeah not fair
[19:03:28] <Sugarloaf0> Lucas_F98: FPGA is <$10 as well.

[19:12:01] <IceDingo> :O
[19:12:08] <LaoD> ok, who here is on TPG?
[19:12:25] <Lucas_F98> ACWL i think
[19:12:32] <LaoD> damn, nobody else?
[19:12:36] <Sugarloaf0> Lucas_F98: What is this I don't even
[19:12:37] <Lucas_F98> nope
[19:12:37] <MatthewJA> who *here* is on it
[19:12:40] <spake> ACWL is on optus
[19:12:42] <MatthewJA> or who who visits here is on it
[19:12:52] <LaoD> MatthewJA: Both?
[19:12:53] <spake> you can use /who to get everyone's hostnames
[19:12:54] <MatthewJA> all I remember is that simon is on tpg and it makes me lol
[19:13:00] <IceDingo> nope seems like noone here atm
[19:13:12] <Lucas_F98> there goes testing
[19:13:16] <LaoD> xD
[19:13:27] <LaoD> I'll have to try it with freenode or something
[19:13:27] <IceDingo> butbut... other isps? :P
[19:13:36] <LaoD> but it picked itself up, so that's good
[19:14:07] <MatthewJA> man I should be studying for my physics exam
[19:14:10] <MatthewJA> also my engineering exam
[19:14:14] <MatthewJA> which I don't know when it is
[19:14:15] <IceDingo> MatthewJA, me too!
[19:14:18] <Sugarloaf0> Then do it?
[19:14:19] <IceDingo> Physics tomorrow
[19:14:19] <Sugarloaf0> :P
[19:14:23] <MatthewJA> woo physics tomorrow
[19:14:25] <MatthewJA> ^5
[19:14:30] <MatthewJA> don't be silly, sugarloaf0
[19:14:32] <spake> MatthewJA: i had engineering yesterday
[19:14:37] [disconnected at Tue Aug 07 19:14:37 2012]
[19:14:39] [connected at Tue Aug 07 19:14:39 2012]
[19:14:47] <MatthewJA> but they have not told me when
[19:14:53] <LaoD> how did ACWL get his bot to respond to @reload?
[19:14:58] <MatthewJA> I went up to the deputy, and she was all
[19:15:04] <MatthewJA> "you have to organise the exam yourself"
[19:15:04] <spake> LaoD: it's only programmed to respond to him
[19:15:05] <MatthewJA> -> what
[19:15:31] <IceDingo> MatthewJA, are you like the only one that does engineering or something?
[19:15:33] <spake> LaoD: oh, also, NCSSBot is coded using sockets, not an IRC module
[19:15:44] <LaoD> >_> wut
[19:15:45] <MatthewJA> no, there's at least one more
[19:16:03] <LaoD> spake: Wow, that's pretty hectic.
[19:16:07] <MatthewJA> I don't even know any more
[19:16:14] <spake> LaoD: the code is on git
[19:16:19] <MatthewJA> I haven't finished telecom yet... I really need to do that
[19:16:23] <LaoD> can someone using freenode reconnect for me please? :D
[19:16:27] <spake> LaoD: https://github.com/AClockWorkLemon/NCSSBot
[19:16:31] <IceDingo> spake, is that git up to date?
[19:16:34] <LaoD> spake: Thanks :)
[19:16:36] <spake> LaoD: we're all using freenode!!!
[19:16:40] <spake> IceDingo: nope
[19:16:49] <IceDingo> spake, rightio
[19:16:53] <spake> IceDingo: we're working out of dropbox at the moment
[19:16:55] * LaoD facepalm
[19:16:57] <Sugarloaf0> spake: I did a Letters and Numbers bot with sockets. Not quite as modular as NCSSBot though. :P
[19:17:18] <spake> Sugarloaf0: heh
[19:17:19] * LaoD facepalm
[19:17:40] <IceDingo> brb! :O
[19:17:42] * Lucas_F98 facedesks
[19:17:46] <LaoD> Sugarloaf0: That would be awesome :D
[19:18:01] <spake> Sugarloaf0: last year, both ACWL and I made modular bots designed to respond to commands, and I made a bot that regularly polled the challenge site for score updates, but didn't respond to commands
[19:18:06] <LaoD> ok, how about someone using the freenode webclient?
[19:18:14] <spake> Sugarloaf0: so NCSSBot was an attempt to make a bot that had both
[19:18:23] <MatthewJA> what do you need done, LaoD?
[19:18:39] <LaoD> MatthewJA: Just disconnect and reconnect :)
[19:18:43] <MatthewJA> ok
[19:18:48] <MatthewJA> this isn't just a ploy to get rid of me is it
[19:19:06] <Sugarloaf0> spake: Nice. I like to see people working together on this stuff. It's cool. :)
[19:19:32] <LaoD> Sugarloaf0: Yeah :)
[19:19:34] <Lucas_F98> gotta go maybe on later... bye :)
[19:19:51] <LaoD> spake: Wow, that's pretty cool (the code on git)
[19:19:53] <LaoD> yay :D
[19:20:01] <MatthewJA> yay me
[19:20:04] <MatthewJA> I am back
[19:20:06] <LaoD> now we wait for someone on TPG
[19:20:07] <MatthewJA> all is well again
[19:20:11] * LaoD MUHAHAHA
[19:20:14] <MatthewJA> does it complain about them being on tpg
[19:20:17] <MatthewJA> that's what I'd do 
[19:20:18] <MatthewJA> if I had a bot
[19:20:21] * MatthewJA should write a bot
[19:20:22] <spake> someone lure simon
[19:20:24] <Sugarloaf0> https://github.com/nic-donaldson/Letters-and-Numbers-Bot/ - is the bot for anyone interested. Code is messy and unmaintained. Don't even know if the current revision works. It was just a quick and fun project. :)
[19:20:25] <LaoD> "L0L TPG"
[19:20:29] <MatthewJA> lol
[19:20:50] * MatthewJA 's code is always messy
[19:20:55] <MatthewJA> not as messy as some
[19:20:57] <MatthewJA> :I
[19:21:00] * MatthewJA shudders
[19:21:18] * LaoD 's code barely passes as code, and not adsflkbjagfklbafgbjalsdgjbaskgbjasdklgbjasd-spam
[19:21:50] <MatthewJA> write a parser that interprets code written as adsflkbjagfklbafgbjalsdgjbaskgbjasdklgbjasd-spam
[19:22:00] <MatthewJA> also I retyped all of that, why did I not just copy and paste
[19:22:22] * MatthewJA uses Inspect Element to make everything comic sans
[19:22:30] <MatthewJA> ...
[19:22:31] <MatthewJA> it's
[19:22:33] <MatthewJA> horrible
[19:22:33] <MatthewJA> D:
[19:22:39] <MatthewJA> WHY DID I DO THIS
[19:22:43] * IceDingo noms
[19:23:58] <LaoD> spake: what does it do?
[19:24:06] <spake> LaoD: just another instance
[19:24:09] <LaoD> Oh, off to dinner
[19:24:17] <LaoD> spake: ok :P
[19:24:21] <MatthewJA> ncssbot needs a better name
[19:24:41] <spake> MatthewJA: such as?
[19:24:47] <MatthewJA> "JamesCurranBot"
[19:26:06] <Sugarloaf0> You'd have to implement a "Final Countdown" feature then.
[19:26:12] * spake tries to get reacquainted with the code he wrote a year ago
[19:27:06] * MatthewJA looks at his code from ncss
[19:27:09] * MatthewJA dies
[19:27:15] <spake> hehehe
[19:27:19] <MatthewJA> god
[19:27:20] <MatthewJA> what
[19:27:27] <MatthewJA> I can't have been that terrible
[19:27:50] * Sugarloaf0 wonders if his bot still works
[19:27:59] <spake> MatthewJA: i still have the snailing gif on my desktop!!
[19:28:03] * MatthewJA thinks if you leave code around for a while, it goes bad and stops working
[19:28:04] <MatthewJA> yessssss
[19:28:06] <MatthewJA> snailing
[19:28:09] <MatthewJA> the gif? which one was that
[19:28:23] <Sugarloaf0> There it is. :)
[19:28:57] <Sugarloaf0> @LN START NUMBERS
[19:28:58] <LN_bot> A numbers game has been called, anyone who wishes to play should type 'playing'.  The game will start in about 14 seconds.
[19:29:13] <LN_bot> Not enough players, game will not start
[19:29:33] * MatthewJA had a bot once
[19:29:38] <Sugarloaf0> Missing a full stop... I am ashamed.
[19:29:42] * MatthewJA 's bot threw toast at anyone who mentioned breakfast foods
[19:31:54] <spake> MatthewJA: http://i40.tinypic.com/r1yjow.jpg
[19:31:55] <NCSSBot> r1yjow.jpg: image/gif (535.9KB)
[19:32:05] <MatthewJA> yesssssss
[19:32:12] <MatthewJA> it's called .jpg though
[19:32:14] <MatthewJA> I AM SO CONFUSED
[19:32:22] <Sugarloaf0> Who's on the right?
[19:32:30] <MatthewJA> best
[19:32:32] <MatthewJA> ever
[19:32:36] <Sugarloaf0> Also, crazy cool logo on bottom of shirt. I am jelly.
[19:32:49] <MatthewJA> what, the ncss logo or the atlassian logo
[19:32:58] <Sugarloaf0> The fact that you guys -got- logos.
[19:33:05] <Sugarloaf0> My Atlassian shirt doesn't have them.
[19:33:09] <MatthewJA> hehehe
[19:33:14] <MatthewJA> our atlassian shirt is JUST logos
[19:33:16] <MatthewJA> so many logos
[19:33:21] <MatthewJA> it's also the most comfortable shirt I own
[19:33:23] <Sugarloaf0> It's the same design. :)
[19:33:26] <MatthewJA> I wear it frequently >_>
[19:33:29] <Sugarloaf0> I went 2011.
[19:33:32] <spake> all my shirts are from ncss 2011 and 2012
[19:33:33] <MatthewJA> ahk
[19:33:35] <MatthewJA> hahahaha
[19:33:51] <Sugarloaf0> spake: Yeah, there were a large amount of shirts...
[19:34:03] <Sugarloaf0> The Freelancer ones were particularly flimsy.
[19:34:26] <MatthewJA> it's too cold to wear my freelancer shirt atm
[19:34:26] <MatthewJA> is so thin
[19:34:43] <spake> wear an atlassian shirt whenever you go to the city
[19:34:48] <Sugarloaf0> But then it's all like, "I got this from Matt Barrie. His collar was -popped-"
[19:34:50] <spake> and you become a beacon for other ncss-ers
[19:35:10] <Sugarloaf0> spake: I wear mine all the time. No-one has ever mentioned it. :( In ACT though.
[19:35:10] <spake> or people working at atlassian, i suppose
[19:35:12] <MatthewJA> huh, people are cheating in the challenge
[19:35:16] <spake> Sugarloaf0: aww :(
[19:35:21] <Sugarloaf0> spake: I ran into David Horst while wearing my NCSS shirt though.
[19:35:22] <spake> MatthewJA: whaaa!?
[19:35:27] <MatthewJA> according to the forums
[19:35:36] <MatthewJA> my question is: WHO IS CHEATING IN WEEK ONE 
[19:35:45] <MatthewJA> AND IF THEY ARE DOING SO THEN WHY ARE THEY IN ADVANCED :I
[19:35:57] <ryannathans> how are people cheating
[19:36:02] <MatthewJA> also, my ISS hoodie > beacon than NCSS shirts
[19:36:10] <MatthewJA> posting questions verbatim online
[19:36:14] <MatthewJA> according to this thread
[19:36:16] <ryannathans> where?
[19:36:17] <ryannathans> do want
[19:36:20] <ryannathans> jks
[19:36:26] <MatthewJA> advanced, general discussion
[19:36:36] <MatthewJA> I just don't even
[19:36:40] <spake> welp.
[19:36:51] <MatthewJA> seriously though
[19:36:53] <Sugarloaf0> I'm tempted to Google for the questions now to see where this occurred.
[19:36:57] <spake> yeah
[19:36:59] <MatthewJA> who would cheat in week one?
[19:37:05] <MatthewJA> probably yahoo answers/stack overflow
[19:37:05] <spake> maybe search for one of the q's in stack overflow
[19:37:12] <MatthewJA> I've seen competition questions posted there before
[19:37:13] <MatthewJA> for everything
[19:37:16] <MatthewJA> like the maths comp
[19:37:16] <MatthewJA> :I
[19:37:21] <MatthewJA> but yeah
[19:37:22] <MatthewJA> week one
[19:37:28] <MatthewJA> advanced
[19:37:36] <MatthewJA> I kind of assumed that people in advanced were alright at coding
[19:37:42] <MatthewJA> and the questions were pretty easy this week...
[19:37:47] <spake> i found this o.o
[19:37:48] <spake> http://web2.warilla-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/dept/computing/10%20IST/Software%20Design/Python%20Challenge/questions5.pdf
[19:37:48] <NCSSBot> questions5.pdf: application/pdf (115.8KB)
[19:37:56] <spake> the english-german-english question
[19:38:02] <MatthewJA> that was fun
[19:38:03] <MatthewJA> haha
[19:38:03] <spake> was recycled from 2007! :O
[19:38:25] <MatthewJA> ...
[19:38:26] <Sugarloaf0> spake: I'm not surprised. :P I imagine you guys will see some questions from the 2012 camp show up. Like Bracket Mountains last year.
[19:38:29] <MatthewJA> is this the beginner one?
[19:38:33] <spake> though probably week 5 beginners
[19:38:34] <MatthewJA> OH GOD BRACKET MOUNTAINS
[19:38:35] <MatthewJA> :I
[19:38:41] <spake> back then there was only beginners and advanced
[19:38:55] <MatthewJA> "particularly problem five"
[19:38:56] <MatthewJA> HOT DAMN
[19:38:59] * MatthewJA scrolls to problem five
[19:39:36] <MatthewJA> blimey
[19:39:43] <MatthewJA> that's a difficulty curve from "write a function to remove spaces"
[19:40:04] <Sugarloaf0> I'm not finding any of the problems online.
[19:40:25] <MatthewJA> def remove_spaces(s): return s.replace(" ", "")
[19:41:49] <ryannathans> german-english looks easy
[19:41:51] <DpEpsilon> ohai guis
[19:41:58] <MatthewJA> wasn't german-english in the questions this week
[19:42:01] <MatthewJA> ohai dp
[19:42:37] <spake> DpEpsilon: "Teaching a 15 year old the awesomeness of 2-left counting bloom filters. Seriously. The fuck!?"
[19:42:52] <MatthewJA> oh
[19:42:57] <MatthewJA> so someone has talked about cheating
[19:42:59] <MatthewJA> on another thread now
[19:43:01] <DpEpsilon> spake: where is this posted?
[19:43:06] <spake> DpEpsilon: by alex on fb
[19:43:12] <DpEpsilon> spake: :D
[19:43:22] <DpEpsilon> spake: correct him, I'm 16
[19:43:43] <spake> heh
[19:43:51] <spake> correct him yourself, magicutty :P
[19:43:53] <MatthewJA> you are sixteen?
[19:44:08] <DpEpsilon> spake: facebook shut down my account.
[19:44:16] <DpEpsilon> spake: 5 minute mail lol
[19:44:25] <spake> DpEpsilon: o.o but you're still in my friends list
[19:44:38] <DpEpsilon> also, I can't tell why he's gone "Seriously. The fuck" *exactly*
[19:44:45] <DpEpsilon> spake: still shut down...
[19:44:48] <DpEpsilon> I can't access it.
[19:44:52] <spake> :S
[19:44:53] <spake> alright
[19:44:56] * MatthewJA is sixteen
[19:45:21] <spake> DpEpsilon: i would think it is because most 15 year olds do not know what 2-left counting bloom filters are
[19:45:27] <DpEpsilon> yeah
[19:45:30] <DpEpsilon> that was my first guess.
[19:45:35] <spake> 16*
[19:46:07] <DpEpsilon> :P
[19:46:15] <ryannathans> you can get banned for asking on SO
[19:46:16] <ryannathans> lololol
[19:46:29] <MatthewJA> I can't believe people didn't know that cheating was wrong
[19:46:30] <MatthewJA> in this
[19:46:31] <MatthewJA> seriously
[19:46:40] <MatthewJA> FaithInHumanity--
[19:46:44] <ryannathans> ^
[19:46:59] <DpEpsilon> lol
[19:47:08] <ryannathans> what about return math.radians(degrees)
[19:47:12] <DpEpsilon> Once upon a time
[19:47:17] <MatthewJA> apparently, though, people are really bad at knowing when cheating is wrong
[19:47:25] <DpEpsilon> I caught crawfs on a different irc network
[19:47:26] <MatthewJA> all y11 in nsw have to do a course called all my own work
[19:47:33] <DpEpsilon> asking for help on a question :P
[19:47:34] <MatthewJA> because people didn't know that cheating in the hsc is wrong
[19:47:34] <spake> MatthewJA: oh lawd
[19:47:35] <MatthewJA> :I
[19:47:40] <MatthewJA> seriously what
[19:47:59] <DpEpsilon> MatthewJA: the hsc *itself* is wrong :P
[19:48:05] <spake> but yeah
[19:48:10] <spake> just in case anyone was unaware
[19:48:12] <gagalug> Hello, World!
[19:48:15] <spake> no sharing solutions in here
[19:48:16] <spake> at all
[19:48:20] <MatthewJA> the hsc involves mandatory english
[19:48:20] <MatthewJA> so
[19:48:22] <MatthewJA> it's totally wrong
[19:48:26] <ryannathans> spake: not even hello world?
[19:48:29] <MatthewJA> oh man what about my awesome hello world solution
[19:48:30] <MatthewJA> seriously
[19:48:33] <MatthewJA> you will all fear it
[19:48:36] <spake> ryannathans: especially not hello world!!
[19:48:37] <MatthewJA> and it's glory
[19:48:38] <ryannathans> i beat you at it
[19:48:46] <MatthewJA> 37 lines
[19:48:51] <MatthewJA> did anyone get it any shorter than that?
[19:48:54] <MatthewJA> it was pretty hard
[19:49:02] <ryannathans> False = True
[19:49:03] <ryannathans> True = 42
[19:49:05] <ryannathans> problem?
[19:49:32] <gagalug> Im not asking for answers but has anyone solved the aardvark challenge?
[19:49:38] <ryannathans> yeh
[19:49:47] <ryannathans> simple one when you read the bloody hint
[19:49:54] * ryannathans didn't read it and tried regex
[19:49:55] <gagalug> omfg
[19:49:56] <gagalug> facepalm
[19:49:58] <MatthewJA> yeah it's not difficult
[19:50:03] <gagalug> omfg
[19:50:04] <gagalug> omfg
[19:50:06] <gagalug> i forgot
[19:50:11] <gagalug> that you can test/count a word
[19:50:14] <ryannathans> lol
[19:50:17] <gagalug> instead of just characters
[19:50:22] <spake> has anyone seen what this dragan kid posted on the forums o.o
[19:50:26] <MatthewJA> yeah
[19:50:28] <MatthewJA> I was gonna post it in here
[19:50:29] <MatthewJA> but
[19:50:33] <MatthewJA> I didn't know if he was here
[19:50:34] <MatthewJA> lurking
[19:50:35] <MatthewJA> JUDGING
[19:50:41] <gagalug> what?
[19:50:44] <spake> who cares
[19:50:47] <spake> if he was here
[19:50:49] <MatthewJA> ..good point
[19:50:50] <spake> we would hunt him out
[19:50:52] <spake> with pitchforks
[19:50:57] <MatthewJA> "lol Don't go on stack overflow for difficult question solving. I almost learnt the hardway, I had been playing around with the aardvark question for hours posted it on stack overflow and someone ended up giving a different solution to my code, It worked I ended up analysing the code posting it on the site, but it didnt work an hour or so later I get a message that you can get banned for that stuff so just a tip don't che
[19:50:59] <MatthewJA> that?
[19:51:04] <MatthewJA> (it's on my clipboard)
[19:51:08] <spake> yes
[19:51:09] <ryannathans> same
[19:51:12] <ryannathans> i'm looking at it now
[19:51:12] <spake> it's on my clipboard too
[19:51:22] <gagalug> ...
[19:51:24] <gagalug> thats me
[19:51:24] <MatthewJA> ahahaha nice
[19:51:25] <gagalug> ...
[19:51:37] <MatthewJA> maaaan
[19:51:45] <spake> it's perfectly fine to share solutions on the monday after the week
[19:52:03] <spake> for code golf and other noble pursuits
[19:52:46] <gagalug> yeah Im kinda new to this
[19:52:53] <MatthewJA> it's just generally assumed
[19:52:55] <MatthewJA> it's a challenge
[19:53:00] <MatthewJA> and/or competition
[19:53:04] <gagalug> Yeah I knew that but it was first week
[19:53:08] <gagalug> so I kinda disregarded
[19:53:09] <gagalug> haha
[19:53:09] <MatthewJA> posting to stack overflow isn't an option
[19:53:10] <MatthewJA> there's the forums
[19:53:13] <MatthewJA> there's the messages
[19:53:17] <MatthewJA> plenty of places to go!

[19:58:20] <DpEpsilon> hmm?
[19:58:22] <DpEpsilon> wat
[19:58:39] <gagalug> Im not amazing at programming
[19:58:46] <gagalug> and Im one of the best in my school
[19:58:49] <gagalug> which is shameful
[19:58:52] <gagalug> compared to you guys
[19:58:52] <MatthewJA> is jking
[19:58:56] <MatthewJA> for you saying "I'm the best"
[19:58:57] <MatthewJA> lol
[19:58:58] <gagalug> :'(
[19:59:04] * MatthewJA is probably the best at his school...
[19:59:11] <MatthewJA> I wish I did a computer subject XD
[19:59:16] * ryannathans is the best at his school
[19:59:38] <MatthewJA> I am definitely the only python coder I know of at my school
[19:59:43] <spake> MatthewJA: i'm the only person in my grade doing SDD
[19:59:48] <MatthewJA> I was gonna do SDD
[19:59:50] <MatthewJA> BUT THEN I DIDN'T
[19:59:51] <MatthewJA> WHAI
[19:59:52] <spake> MatthewJA: with another school though
[19:59:53] <ryannathans> computer science teacher is contacting a uni to get me work to do in computer science because i'm bored
[19:59:56] <MatthewJA> DE?
[19:59:56] * ryannathans yawns
[20:00:00] <MatthewJA> I do DE engineering :U
[20:00:06] <ryannathans> going to learn assembly and disassembly
[20:00:17] <spake> MatthewJA: sort of, it's with northern beaches christian school
[20:00:19] <DpEpsilon> We have probably > 10 python coders at our school
[20:00:25] <ryannathans> orly
[20:00:26] <spake> MatthewJA: like distance ed, but it's all through moodle
[20:00:30] <DpEpsilon> actually, the SDD class learns python here.
[20:00:38] <MatthewJA> :P
[20:00:41] <MatthewJA> I am so envious
[20:00:43] <MatthewJA> of that subject
[20:00:43] <spake> DpEpsilon: we haven't had an SDD class for so long i don't know what they teach
[20:00:44] <LaoD> Back :D
[20:00:47] <spake> DpEpsilon: but the teacher is shit...
[20:00:48] <MatthewJA> I did not do it
[20:00:48] <MatthewJA> D:
[20:00:59] <LaoD> I changed schools to do SDD
[20:00:59] <spake> we had a few kids in year 11 do hs1917
[20:01:00] <ryannathans> spake: my teacher is shit too
[20:01:06] <ryannathans> spake: database man
[20:01:12] <MatthewJA> my teacher in y9/10 ist was awful at ist
[20:01:15] <spake> ryannathans: hehehe
[20:01:18] <LaoD> ryannathans DATABASES ARE AWESOME :D
[20:01:24] <ryannathans> i want him to update his knowledge
[20:01:26] <MatthewJA> I swear...
[20:01:27] <gagalug> yeah^
[20:01:28] <ryannathans> LaoD: they are.
[20:01:29] <spake> ohhhhh the database man.
[20:01:32] <MatthewJA> him teaching us actionscript
[20:01:34] <MatthewJA> it was painful
[20:01:34] <DpEpsilon> :D
[20:01:35] <ryannathans> my teacher is stuck in the 80s
[20:01:37] <DpEpsilon> the database man!
[20:01:38] <MatthewJA> "variables... hmm what's that"
[20:01:42] <spake> DpEpsilon: yes!
[20:01:43] <LaoD> xD
[20:01:56] <MatthewJA> OH MAN DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THAT TEACHER FROM NCSS WHO KEPT ASKING TROLL QUESTIONS
[20:01:56] <ryannathans> he still insists that L3 ram is on the motherboard
[20:01:59] * ryannathans cries
[20:02:00] <LaoD> so... did anyone get hit by the bot?
[20:02:05] <ryannathans> tpg?
[20:02:08] <spake> MatthewJA: that is the database man
[20:02:13] <MatthewJA> HAHAHAHA
[20:02:13] <MatthewJA> :D
[20:02:14] <ryannathans> rofl
[20:02:21] <spake> MatthewJA: ryannathans's teacher
[20:02:22] <MatthewJA> I did not know he was databaseman
[20:02:22] <ryannathans> that's my teacher D:
[20:02:22] <MatthewJA> I know him only as TrollTeacher
[20:02:26] <MatthewJA> oh man
[20:02:27] <LaoD> xD
[20:02:28] <ryannathans> what were these questions
[20:02:28] <MatthewJA> oh man oh man
[20:02:32] <LaoD> Botten_Lao 
[20:02:35] <LaoD> Botten_Lao:
[20:02:35] <Botten_Lao> LaoD: I am a bot!
[20:02:37] <MatthewJA> ^5 to you, ryannathans
[20:02:43] <spake> a hashtable is a lot like a database
[20:02:51] <ryannathans> o.0
[20:03:09] <LaoD> spake: no?
[20:03:28] <MatthewJA> what questions
[20:03:29] <MatthewJA> like
[20:03:36] <ryannathans> in class he still tells us todays programming languages are useless with no 'post test loops' and python lacking a 'case' and other stuff....
[20:03:37] <MatthewJA> james curran demonstrates functions in python
[20:03:45] <MatthewJA> "how do you define a procedure?"
[20:03:50] <ryannathans> o.0
[20:03:51] <ryannathans> what 
[20:03:53] <ryannathans> no biat
[20:03:55] <spake> LaoD: that's what the database man said
[20:03:56] <ryannathans> no bait?
[20:04:07] <LaoD> spake: Lolwhat?
[20:04:14] <MatthewJA> james curran: "a procedure is a function that does not return. procedures have not been separated from functions for x many years."
[20:04:28] <ryannathans> yeah 30 years
[20:04:32] <MatthewJA> hahhaa
[20:04:33] <ryannathans> that's how old his knowledge is
[20:04:34] <MatthewJA> so funny
[20:04:38] <MatthewJA> I had a conversation with him
[20:04:39] <MatthewJA> on the opening day
[20:04:43] <MatthewJA> that was interesting
[20:04:44] <LaoD> spake: Hashtables are designed to be redundant... lol?
[20:04:56] <ryannathans> MatthewJA: what convo
[20:04:59] <MatthewJA> he still knows more about programming than my ist teacher tho
[20:05:04] <MatthewJA> idr most of it
[20:05:05] <spake> lets all go to usyd and we can be a family again!
[20:05:08] <MatthewJA> he mentioned a server of some sort
[20:05:09] <MatthewJA> usyd!
[20:05:15] <LaoD> :P
[20:05:16] * MatthewJA applies to ANU
[20:05:20] <MatthewJA> plleeease accept me anu
[20:05:23] <MatthewJA> ACCEPT MEEEE
[20:05:25] <LaoD> xD
[20:05:38] <LaoD> Good luck... >96 Atar :P
[20:05:49] <spake> also fact that it is in act
[20:05:58] <LaoD> no!!!
[20:06:04] <MatthewJA> I'm going for a 96 atar
[20:06:06] <spake> and that i am in sydney
[20:06:06] <MatthewJA> so
[20:06:19] <MatthewJA> hopefully I keep up my marks!
[20:06:27] <LaoD> MatthewJA: I take my hat off to you then.... well, my headset anyway.
[20:06:28] <MatthewJA> 97 in my last ext1 maths test :o
[20:06:30] <DpEpsilon> fuck atar
[20:06:33] <LaoD> ^
[20:06:38] <MatthewJA> my atar might be brought down by english though
[20:06:39] <MatthewJA> so
[20:06:42] <MatthewJA> that makes me very unhappy
[20:06:47] <MatthewJA> I am good at my relevant subjects
[20:06:50] <MatthewJA> less so at english
[20:06:55] <MatthewJA> also, my ext english teacher hates me
[20:06:56] <ryannathans> english won't be a part of my atar score
[20:06:58] <ryannathans> ehehhehe
[20:07:01] <ryannathans> woop woop
[20:07:05] <LaoD> why is that?
[20:07:07] <DpEpsilon> and besides, I'm quite able to worm my way up as long as my atar is over 81.
[20:07:10] <MatthewJA> so I got at least 3 marks less than someone who did equally well as me in the last assessment
[20:07:12] <ryannathans> physics, chem, math, computer science are my top 4
[20:07:19] <MatthewJA> english WILL count toward your atar
[20:07:21] <MatthewJA> 1/5 has to
[20:07:24] <spake> english always counts
[20:07:25] <DpEpsilon> ryannathans: english *has* to be a part of your atar score.
[20:07:26] <MatthewJA> it's part of 'english is mandatory'
[20:07:27] <ryannathans> no it doesnt
[20:07:27] <LaoD> ryannathans: They always take english
[20:07:29] <MatthewJA> that's why I'm so rage
[20:07:30] <ryannathans> no it doesn't...
[20:07:31] <LaoD> Yes it does
[20:07:32] <MatthewJA> it does
[20:07:32] <ryannathans> NO IT DOESN'T
[20:07:34] <MatthewJA> english does
[20:07:35] <MatthewJA> trust me
[20:07:36] <MatthewJA> it does
[20:07:36] <LaoD> DOES
[20:07:37] <ryannathans> IT'S YOUR BEST 4 SCORES
[20:07:38] <MatthewJA> that's why everyone hates it
[20:07:39] <ryannathans> NO IT DOESN'T
[20:07:41] <ryannathans> YOU'RE ALL WRONG
[20:07:44] <MatthewJA> IT'S YOUR BEST 2 UNITS OF ENGLISH
[20:07:45] <LaoD> You're outnumbered
[20:07:48] <ryannathans> NO IT'S NOT
[20:07:50] <MatthewJA> + YOUR BEST 8 UNITS AFTER THAT
[20:07:52] <ryannathans> GO LOOK AT ATAR WEBSITE
[20:07:53] <ryannathans> WRONG.
[20:07:55] <MatthewJA> NO U
[20:08:02] * MatthewJA gestures
[20:08:03] <MatthewJA> naaaaaaaaarghh
[20:08:07] <ryannathans> it's listed as a common myth
[20:08:08] <MatthewJA> nooooarrrgh
[20:08:09] <MatthewJA> port douglas
[20:08:14] <MatthewJA> wait really???
[20:08:17] * MatthewJA 's day gets better
[20:08:18] <ryannathans> yeah..
[20:08:21] <MatthewJA> THOSE ENGLISH TEACHERS
[20:08:23] <MatthewJA> WERE LYING TOME
[20:08:24] <MatthewJA> gaeiwgnaewiognewa
[20:08:26] <ryannathans> it's your top 4 subjects in year 12
[20:08:36] <MatthewJA> wait up
[20:08:38] <MatthewJA> 4 subjects
[20:08:40] <MatthewJA> = 8 units
[20:08:41] <LaoD> Plus english.
[20:08:42] <MatthewJA> 10 units for atar
[20:08:45] <MatthewJA> + english, yeah
[20:08:48] <ryannathans> not plus english
[20:08:49] <LaoD> To be more correct
[20:08:54] <LaoD> it is your best 8 units
[20:08:58] <LaoD> plus english
[20:09:02] <MatthewJA> dammit ry an
[20:09:06] <MatthewJA> you got my hopes up!
[20:09:11] <LaoD> Sure is, gimme a sec to find the BOS page
[20:09:18] <spake> ryannathans: 10 minutes in the ncss dungeon!
[20:09:22] <ryannathans> gimme a sec to find the page
[20:09:35] <ryannathans> what's hsc?
[20:09:51] <MatthewJA> lol tpg
[20:09:52] <spake> noooooo
[20:09:54] <spake> svict4 is here
[20:09:56] <spake> but
[20:10:01] <spake> using webchat :'(
[20:10:06] <svict4> MatthewJA: ಠ_ಠ
[20:10:17] <MatthewJA> :D
[20:10:23] <ryannathans> svict4: these people are trying to say english must go towards your atar
[20:10:25] <svict4> yeahh, im still trying to get the hang of irssi so i'm giving it a miss for the time
[20:10:38] <ryannathans> bah
[20:10:48] <svict4> english does go towards ur ATAR score?
[20:10:53] <ryannathans> NOT YOU TOO
[20:10:54] <MatthewJA> good job queenslander
[20:10:59] <MatthewJA> you are more correct than ryan
[20:11:12] <svict4> :D
[20:12:51] <svict4> well in our system, it is the the 5 top _eligible_ subjects that is counted
[20:12:56] <MatthewJA> "To be eligible for an ATAR in 2011 you must satisfactorily complete at least 10 units of ATAR courses. These ATAR courses  must include at least:  eight units from Category A courses  two units of English  three Board Developed courses of two units  four subjects."
[20:13:07] <svict4> so, unless you are doing pretty bad at english then it wouldn't count
[20:13:19] <svict4> and yeah you MUST do math and english
[20:13:24] <MatthewJA> makes me rage
[20:13:26] <spake> MatthewJA: perhaps it works different in other states?
[20:13:39] <MatthewJA> If it does
[20:13:41] <LaoD> ryannathans: http://www.uac.edu.au/documents/atar/ATAR-FAQs.pdf Page 20, first paragraph
[20:13:42] <NCSSBot> ATAR-FAQs.pdf: application/pdf (1.0MB)
[20:13:42] <ryannathans> must do math?
[20:13:43] <MatthewJA> then it's unfairly being compared
[20:13:44] <ryannathans> not here
[20:13:46] <MatthewJA> against other states
[20:13:57] <LaoD> ryannathans No, maths is not compulsory
[20:14:06] <svict4> (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ freaking wish the national curriculum would come in already
[20:14:10] <MatthewJA> yes that
[20:14:11] <LaoD> ^^
[20:14:20] <MatthewJA> plz no more talk about english kthx

[17:26:04] <DpEpsilon> LaoD: I would, but I'm a tad busy with debugging my own stuff.
[17:26:08] <IceDingo> it should only count first ones right?
[17:26:23] <LaoD> it's deleting the letters again
[17:26:30] <LaoD> I've narrowed it down to a few lines
[17:26:42] <IceDingo> something to do with copying a list
[17:26:47] <LaoD> self.letters = self.originals
[17:26:47] <LaoD>         for letter in word:
[17:26:47] <LaoD>             print letter,"".join(self.letters),"".join(self.originals) 
[17:26:47] <LaoD>             if letter in self.originals and letter in self.letters:
[17:26:47] <LaoD>                 print "Removing",letter
[17:26:48] <LaoD>                 self.letters.remove(letter)
[17:26:48] <IceDingo> but it doesn't actually copy
[17:26:49] <LaoD>                 continue
[17:26:51] <LaoD>             else:

[17:27:44] <IceDingo> like i said^
[17:27:48] <DpEpsilon> yes! I can write that!
[17:28:07] <IceDingo> so it removes it from letters and originals right?
[17:28:17] <spake> AClockWorkLemon: yeah
[17:28:30] <grc> try: self.letters = self.originals[:]
[17:28:31] <LaoD> IceDingo: Yeah, but it's only meant to touch letters and leave the orignals.
[17:28:34] <AClockWorkLemon> spake: are you using the incoming/outgoing hooks in challengebot.py?
[17:28:35] <Doink> Spake: are you using the solar hooks in challengebot.py?
[17:28:41] <grc> so you copy it rather than copy the reference
